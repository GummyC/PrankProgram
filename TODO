make loader more universal by allowing it to run any program
change shared variable names to more universal ones to help with ease of syntax


Main:
    - make play button just execute file so that loader can call the same function regardless of files purpose
    - move sleep loop to the play function so that the loader's sole purpose is to load any py file

Loader:
    - remove sleep loop
